### Hi I'm Gregor (He/Him)
Junior Python Developer at TeamWeb.

I am recently completed my HND Mechatronics at City of Glasgow College and I am currently working on the CodeCademy Computer Science and Full Stack Engineer Career Paths, as well as completing modules on Hack the Box Academy.  I enjoy writing code, building robots and designing PCB's.

I am looking to collaborate on anything!  I would love to meet people to work on projects with.  Get in touch!  

Projects to automate off-grid living are definitely of special interest to me!

You can find me on [LinkedIn.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregorritchie/)

If I'm not at my desk I'm probably fixing my Classic VW van, or riding my motorbike.
