### Hi I'm Gregor (He/Him)
Python Developer at TeamWeb.

I have a HND in Mechatronics from City of Glasgow College. I enjoy writing code, building robots and other DIY projects.

My current goal is to continue growing my skills and experience to grow into a Senior Developer.

You can find me on [LinkedIn.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregorritchie/)

If I'm not at my desk I'm probably building something in my shed, fixing my Classic VW van, or riding my motorbike.
