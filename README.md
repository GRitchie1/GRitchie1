### Hi I'm Gregor (He, Him)

I'm currently working on several personal projects but I am mainly focusing on upskilling and adding more strings to my bow to allow me to become a Software Engineer.

I am currently doing my HND Mechatronics at City of Glasgow Colllege and working on the CodeCademy Computer Science and Full Stack Engineer Career Paths, as well as completing modules on Hack the Box Academy.  I enjoy building robots, designing PCB's and writing code.

I am looking to collaborate on anything!  Get in touch, I love to learn about all sorts of projects!  Anything that helps automate off-grid living is definitely of special interest to me!

You can find me on [LinkedIn.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregorritchie/)

If I'm not at my desk I'm probably fixing my Classic VW van, or riding my motorbike.
